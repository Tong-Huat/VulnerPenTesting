# VulnerPenTesting
Automate the process of finding vulnerabilities in local networks to stay up to date and protect our assets.
Automation will save time and effort as it reduces the need for work hours to conduct repeated processes manually and importantly, it can also reduce the probability of human errors when carrying out repetitive tasks.
The main objectives of the automation process are:
1. UseNmapportscantoscanthenetworkforportsandservices
• Doing a port scan allows us to identify vulnerabilities, access points and any other potentially sensitive information related to the open ports.
2. Map vulnerabilities using Nmap-vulners scan
• Nmap-vulners queries the Vulners exploit database when we use the NSE script. We are able to discover CVEs related to the open ports and services
• Nmap-vulners is also preferred over Nmap-vuln script as it is much shorter and more realistic to run over large networks
3. Check for weak login credentials using Medusa to brute force the various services
• Testing for weak login credentials is a critical security measure as they can be used to exploit the system and may lead to potential data breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive information
• Therefore it is very important to identify weak login credentials and rectify the vulnerabilities.
